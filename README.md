# Time Series Analysis of Agricultural Market Data
## Harvard University, STAT 131 - Time Series
## Jordan Turley

This is the final project for STAT 131 - Time Series at Harvard University. I performed a statistical analysis of agricultural market data from the past 40 years using time series methods.

The code and data are located in [code/](https://github.com/ztizzlegaming/agricultural-time-series/tree/master/code), the proposal and final report are in [reports/](https://github.com/ztizzlegaming/agricultural-time-series/tree/master/reports), and the plots used in the reports are in [plots/](https://github.com/ztizzlegaming/agricultural-time-series/tree/master/plots).

The final report is here: [Time Series Modeling of Agricultural Market Data.pdf](https://github.com/ztizzlegaming/agricultural-time-series/blob/master/reports/Time%20Series%20Modeling%20of%20Agricultural%20Market%20Data.pdf).

### Usage

First, clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/ztizzlegaming/agricultural-time-series
    
Next, in [code/final_project.R](https://github.com/ztizzlegaming/agricultural-time-series/blob/master/code/final_project.R), replace the [path variable](https://github.com/ztizzlegaming/agricultural-time-series/blob/6c4ff4c399f2a3b99c9b8ddadcaf6b2605314969/code/final_project.R#L5) with the path to the code/data folder. For example, if you cloned the repo to your desktop, it will be something like:

    path = '~/Desktop/agricultural-time-series/code/'
    
You should then be able to run the file using R-Studio or the command line.
